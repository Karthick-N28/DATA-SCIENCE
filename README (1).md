# Predicting Air Quality Levels using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting air quality levels (e.g., AQI) using advanced machine learning algorithms. It aims to provide insights into pollution patterns and environmental health using data-driven approaches.

## Objectives
- Predict AQI levels based on environmental parameters.
- Compare models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Visualize pollutant impact and trends over time.

## Technologies Used
- Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- IDE: Jupyter Notebook or VS Code

## How to Use
1. Install dependencies.
2. Run `source_code.py` to train and test models.
3. Use predictions and plots for insights.
